            <h1>Memory Map: Beijing| California| Amsterdam</h1>
            <p>A map of my personal memories in the places I've lived in, I explored what is the meaning of home and what does it mean for one to relocate and adapting, grow new memories in a new city.</p>
                
            <p>   I've relocated many times so each of this places feels both familiar and very distant to me. 
                The idea of home is tricky: when I was building my memory database,I walked through the google map in each city I stayed at some point of my life,I had labelled them to be my 'home address', I had my breakdown or go-to places in Amsterdam, California,...

However, my data of Beijing is Null.
The place where I was born and had so much memories at is simply not reachable on GoogleMap or in real life when it is the time that all of the flights back home is cancelled due to the policy, so it seems impossible to reach,
The null data of Beijing on Google Map almost feels like a metaphor that I am so detached from a huge part of my life. Thereâ€™s something so profound there but it feels like almost never existed.
