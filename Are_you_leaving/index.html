            <h1>Under the Gaze</h1>
            <p>Final project made with openframeworks opencv</p>
            <p>A weird creature with monitors and cables as its body parts showing itself and the exhibition. Each of its eyes runs as an individual program, an automated body on its own, which detects anyone and anything in the exhibition space as « object » and stare at them. Viewers have very limited control over it, u can make it continue if the eyes stops to gaze at u, however, the process automatically continues after a 20 secs stop-time, searching for targets again…You never knew whether it is staring at you or how does it sees u.

                You are watching it while also being watched, challenging our ways of seeing and being seen.
